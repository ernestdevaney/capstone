        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Cyclistic is a bike-sharing program featuring 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Daily rates are available, as well as monthly memberships. For the purpose of this project, daily users will be referred to as “casual”, while those with a monthly membership will be known as “members”.</p>
	    
	<p>Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, it is believed that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, it is believed that there is an opportunity to convert casual riders into members.</p>

	<p>The questions posed are:</p>

 
	<ol>
	    <li>How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?</li>

	    <li>Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?</li>

	    <li>How can Cyclistic convert casual riders to become members?</li>
	</ol>


<p>Cyclistic is a fictional company, but for this project, we will be using actual data provided by Motivate International under this license: <a href="https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement" target="_blank">https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement</a></p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
	    <p>I used RStudio to combine, clean, and analyze the data. I then used Tableau Public to analyze further and to create visualizations. Tableau Prep was used to wrangle data at this point.</p>
        <h3>Microsoft Excel</h3>
	    <p>After downloading twelve months’ worth of data, I opened each sheet in Excel to take a quick look at what I was going to be dealing with. I also made sure that all of the columns were the same throughout all twelve files.</p>
        <h3>RStudio</h3>
        <p>Link to code: <a href="https://github.com/ernestdevaney/r-capstone/blob/dc81b48d364fa9a78b7858d6a38ebd298a7b92d4/CyclisticProject.Rmd" target="_blank">https://github.com/ernestdevaney/r-capstone/blob/dc81b48d364fa9a78b7858d6a38ebd298a7b92d4/CyclisticProject.Rmd</a></p>
	<p>HTML version: <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ernestdevaney/r-capstone/blob/main/CyclisticProject.html" target="_blank">https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ernestdevaney/r-capstone/blob/main/CyclisticProject.html</a></p>

<p>Since I was dealing with millions of rows of data, I went with R instead of attempting to do much in Excel.<p>

	<ol>
		<li>I loaded all twelve files and looked at the structure of each to look for inconsistencies in variable names and string types.</li>
		<li>I combined all twelve sets into one.</li>
		<li>Checked for duplicates.</li>
		<li>Formalized the date format and split it into columns for day of month, month, and year.</li>
		<li>I created a column for ride length, in seconds.</li>
		<li>I removed trips shorter than two minutes, and all rows with blank station names.</li>
		<li>Removed all rows with “docked bike” as a ride type.</li>
		<li>After some light exploration, I exported my cleaned data set to .csv.</li>
	</ol>
		
		
<h3>Tableau Public</h3>
	    <p>Link to Tableau project: <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/Cyclistic_Capstone_Project/Sheet10?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link" target="_blank">https://public.tableau.com/views/Cyclistic_Capstone_Project/Sheet10?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link</a></p>
<ol>
    <li>After connecting the data source, I started creating charts and graphs to test assumptions and to get a visual overview of the data.</li>
    <li>I created a series of slides comparing usage differences between Casual and Member riders.</li>
    <li>I wanted to create a map where all start and end stations were combined into the same two rows (longitude and latitude). Tableau Public only allows you to pivot two columns per data source. After some research, I decided to use Tableau Prep to accomplish my goal.</li>
</ol>

	    <h3>Tableau Prep</h3>
<ol>
    <li>I connected the data source and split it into two “clean” steps.</li>
    <li>In each, I deleted one set of station data (start or end).</li>
    <li>In each, I added a column called “Station”, entering 1 for start station information, and 2 for end station information. This was so that I would still be able to differentiate between the two later if I chose to.</li>
    <li>I then joined the two sets back together and created a new data set.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Tableau Public</h3>
<ol start="4">
    <li>I connected to the new data set and created the map I had envisioned.</li>
</ol>


        <h2>Summary of Data</h2>
        <p>For more information, please view my PowerPoint presentation here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GOeN4oLpWre8b-p6-F2entHBSBhAHqI6/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116626800343176221320&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank">Cyclistic Capstone Project</a><p>

        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
        <ul>
            	<li> A monthly email/newsletter featuring local events. Emphasize the proximity of each event to nearby bike stations and the fact that they won’t have to look for/pay for parking upon arrival. The newsletter could include discounts for local restaurants, theaters, attractions, museums, etc. Examples: Show your Membership Pass to the Children’s Museum for a Buy-One-Get-One-Free discount. Show your Membership Pass at the nearby movie theater for a free large soda with any ticket purchase.</li>
		<li>The most popular station for Casuals is right outside of the Chicago Children’s Museum on the bustling Navy Pier. On the Museum’s website, they list various methods of transport to their location, but Cyclistic is not mentioned. Consider asking the Museum, and other local businesses at Navy Pier, to add Cyclistic as an option alongside their directions for arrival via car, public transport, etc.</li>
		<li>Recommend offering a family membership.</li>
		<li>An ad campaign stressing togetherness, being present, getting exercise, going on adventures, no parking fees, no traffic, eco-friendly, and reminding people that life is a journey.</li>
		<li>Annual Membership could include a specific amount of free or discounted day passes for guests, the way that theme park annual passes often do.</li>
		<li>If possible, offer a discount on an annual membership when a customer is returning a bike, taking at least the cost of the daily pass out of the membership.</li>
        </ul>
